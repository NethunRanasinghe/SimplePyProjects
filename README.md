# SimpleStuff
In this repo , I'll add some simple programs and scripts I make.

I'm very new to programming but I like to learn more and experiment with new things.
Recently I started learning python and I made some simple scripts and softwares so I decided to share them with the world.
They maybe basic as it get and there maybe certain ways to do it easier, but I hope these will help atleast for a few.

(There will be more stuff in the future not only from python.)
Thank You !
