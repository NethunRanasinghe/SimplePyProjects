I made a simple price increment calculator. 
Mainly for my personal use as it was very useful for me when I started trading. 
You can compile it with any method you like ( Ex:- pyinstaller). 
I didn't added the compiled version because most of the stuff compiled with pyinstaller showed as a virus on some other computers that I tested it. 
(Mainly on MacAfee installed computers, I have kaspersky installed and it works without an issue)
